Wherever ice shelves are topographically confined, they provide buttressing forces to the grounded glaciers. When ice shelves thin, a decrease in buttressing can lead to an increase in ice flow speeds and hence the rate at which grounded ice is lost increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to model a very simple overturning flow that can occur in ice shelf cavities, known as an 'Ice Pump' mechanism. Melting ice injects buoyant, fresh water into the domain, which in turn drives overturning ocean circulation within the cavity. The freezing point of water decreases with depth so, in some cases, ice that melts at depth in the cavity can refreeze closer to the ocean surface, thus transporting ice up the underside of the ice shelf. We will see some frazil ice effects in the next tutorial hopefully!\n",
